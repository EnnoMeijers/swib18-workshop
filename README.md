## Abstract

From LOD to LOUD: making data usable

Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) extends Linked Open Data (LOD) by focussing on use cases, being as simple as possible, and providing developer friendly web APIs with JSON-LD. The term was coined [by Rob Sanderson](https://www.slideshare.net/azaroth42/europeanatech-keynote-shout-it-out-loud). [This workshop](http://swib.org/swib18/programme.html#abs03) will introduce you to the basic concepts of LOUD, web APIs, and JSON-LD. You'll learn how to publish and document data as LOUD, and how to use that data in different contexts.

In this workshop, we will:

- Convert RDF data into usable [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
- Index and query the data with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
- Create a simple web application using the data
- Visualize the data with [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)
- Document the data with [Hypothesis annotations](https://web.hypothes.is/)
- Use the data with [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)

Audience: librarians and developers working with linked open data.

Requirements: Laptop with [Elasticsearch 6.x](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html), [OpenRefine 2.8](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions), a text editor, web browser, and a command line with [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and [jsonld.js via node.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js#installation). As an alternative, we'll also provide a fully configured virtual machine to workshop participants.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

With sample commands for Debian-based Linux systems, follow links for others.

#### Basic tools

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/):

`apt install git`

Install [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html):

`apt install curl`

Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/):

`apt install jq`

Install [bzip2](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/):

`apt install bzip2`

#### Node.js

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (8.x or higher):

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -`

`apt install -y nodejs`

#### jsonld-cli

Install the hbz [jsonld-cli](https://github.com/hbz/jsonld-cli) fork:

`git clone https://github.com/hbz/jsonld-cli.git`

`cd jsonld-cli`

`sudo npm install -g`

For details, see [the setup instructions](https://github.com/hbz/jsonld-cli#installation).

#### Elasticsearch

Install [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html) 6.x:

`wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -`

`apt install apt-transport-https`

`echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list`

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install elasticsearch`

`sudo -i service elasticsearch start`

Wait a few seconds for Elasticsearch to start up, then open [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/) to verify Elasticsearch is running.

### Repository

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/hbz/swib18-workshop.git`

Go to the repo:

`cd swib18-workshop`

## Usage

### Command line

Run all (convert, index, and query sample data):

`cd data` ; `./process.sh`

Open `process.sh` in an editor for individual commands.

### Browser

Open `data/index.html` in a web browser.

### Node

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Run the code (in `js/app.js`):

`npm start`
